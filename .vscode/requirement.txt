Hi Puneeth,
We are happy to inform you that you have been selected for our next round of interview. From now on it will all be technical. Our next round is a simple task. You need to develop a certain set of features using ReactJS. Please find the details of the task below:

Task:
Build a web app which will have the following features:
•	Should be able to connect to https://newsapi.org/ and fetch news articles
•	Build a screen which shows top 10 headlines
•	Include a search box on top. Search should do a call to newsapi and fetch relevant articles.
•	Clicking on the headline should take the user to the article with a back button. The back button will take the user back to the article list.
Requirements:
•	User reactJS, preferably create-react-app
•	Use the https://newsapi.org/ api to retrieve the data
•	Pay attention to semantics: any HTML might work, but choosing the right tags show you care
•	Show us you know how to create a modern user interface using CSS or any CSS preprocessor / CSS-in-JS
•	Send multiple requests to the news api concurrently
•	Handle error and exception conditions.
•	Give importance to user experience. Let the user know what is happening in the background.
•	Comments will have added value.
Deliverable:
The deliverable for this task should be a zip file or github repo containing the react application. You should make sure that it’s easy to start the application.

Time:
You need to submit the code on or before 9th of October. Feel free to let us know in advance if there is going to be any delay.

If you need any clarification, you can mail me back. If needed we can also schedule a call to clear things out.

All the best and hope to see your reply soon.
